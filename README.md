# Dependancies

We ran these tests with only four major dependencies:

Node.js:
https://nodejs.org/en/ 
*C8
*Chai
*Mocha
*Mochawesome

If you wish to recreate the test environment, then you would need to install Node.js either through an executable or through a package manager. Thankfully Node.js is quite easy to set up.

Now is a good time to also download or clone our team’s test library through GitHub.

After either manual download or git cloning our team’s testing repository, the user should place it somewhere in the local computer’s memory and head to the directory of the newly acquired test folder’s directory. When in the directory, the user should open command prompt and execute command npm install in the directory. This will download all the dependencies all according to the package.json file. After completing this step successfully, the user should be able to run the tests with npm test command.
